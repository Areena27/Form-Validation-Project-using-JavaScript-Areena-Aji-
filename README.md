# Form Validation using JavaScript
This project demonstrates how to implement basic client-side form validation using JavaScript. The form includes fields like name, email, and password, and ensures that the data entered by the user meets the specified requirements before allowing submission.

### Features
- Name Validation: Ensures the name field is not empty.
- Email Validation: Checks if the email is in a valid format (e.g., user@example.com).
- Password Validation: Validates that the password meets a minimum length requirement.
- Real-time Feedback: Provides immediate feedback to users, highlighting errors as they occur.
- Error Messages: Displays clear error messages next to each form field that needs correction.
- Simple Design: Minimalistic UI to focus on the core functionality of form validation.

### Technologies Used
- HTML5: For structuring the form and other content on the page.
- CSS3: Used to style the form and error messages.
- JavaScript: The core logic for validating the form fields and providing feedback to the user
